The code is adapted from the NMF_CD package for solving non-negative matrix factorization. 

Download of the datasets: 

CBCL: best download the preprocessed version from http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~cjhsieh/nmf/

Reuters: Install the python nltk and run the ReutPrint.py script. We recommend to turn then the matrix in a .mat file for loading speed.

The KNIX dataset can be downloaded from: http://www.osirix-viewer.com/resources/dicom-image-library/. The raw data is loaded automatically in the getdcm.m script

To reproduce the experiment run the cbcl_run script and de-comment the dataset you want to use.
